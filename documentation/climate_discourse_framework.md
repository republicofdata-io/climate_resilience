# Climate Discourse Framework: Categories and Sub-Categories

## Introduction
Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges, and how it is discussed—across regions, sectors, and communities—plays a critical role in shaping perceptions, policies, and actions. The **Climate Discourse Framework** provides a structured approach to categorize and analyze these discussions, enabling a deeper understanding of the diverse perspectives and narratives around climate change.

This framework builds on the foundational work of Leichenko & O’Brien, which identifies four primary discourses about climate change: **Biophysical**, **Critical**, **Dismissive**, and **Integrative**. While these high-level categories are useful for organizing broad perspectives, this framework introduces **sub-categories** to capture the nuanced and specific narratives emerging within each discourse.

### Purpose of the Framework
The goal of the Climate Discourse Framework is to:
- Provide a systematic way to analyze climate narratives across time and geography.
- Enable more precise tracking of how narratives form, compete, and evolve.
- Support policymakers, researchers, and communicators in identifying key narratives and designing targeted strategies.

### Why Sub-Categories?
High-level categories are essential for framing broad trends, but climate discourse is highly complex and context-dependent. Sub-categories allow for:
- **Granularity**: Breaking down broader discourses into specific themes for richer analysis.
- **Relevance**: Capturing emerging narratives and evolving public perceptions.
- **Actionability**: Providing actionable insights for communication, policymaking, and advocacy.

The following sections outline the framework’s four main categories and their corresponding sub-categories, each designed to reflect the diversity and complexity of climate change discussions.

## **1. Biophysical**
Climate change is an environmental problem that can be addressed through policies, technologies, and behavioral changes to reduce emissions and adapt to impacts.

### Sub-Categories:
- **Technological Solutions**: Narratives about renewable energy, carbon capture, electric vehicles, and other innovations to combat climate change.
- **Policy Advocacy**: Calls for regulatory action such as carbon taxes, emissions caps, or international agreements to mitigate climate change.
- **Behavioral Change**: Discussions about individual actions like reducing waste, conserving energy, or adopting sustainable diets.
- **Nature-Based Solutions**: Emphasis on solutions like reforestation, wetlands restoration, and biodiversity conservation to address climate challenges.
- **Disaster Preparedness**: Focus on adaptation measures like planning and infrastructure to handle climate-induced disasters.

## **2. Critical**
Climate change is a social problem caused by unsustainable economic, political, and cultural processes. Addressing it requires challenging power structures and unsustainable systems.

### Sub-Categories:
- **Climate Justice**: Narratives highlighting equity issues and the disproportionate impact of climate change on marginalized or vulnerable communities.
- **Fossil Fuel Opposition**: Critiques of industries and systems that perpetuate emissions, including divestment and anti-fossil fuel campaigns.
- **Economic Critique**: Arguments against capitalism, overconsumption, and global economic systems that drive environmental degradation.
- **Global Inequities**: Discussions about the uneven responsibilities and impacts of climate change between the Global North and South.
- **Corporate Accountability**: Calls for corporations to take responsibility for their emissions, lobbying efforts, and greenwashing practices.

---

## **3. Dismissive**
Climate change is not an urgent or real problem, and action to address it is either unnecessary or harmful.

### Sub-Categories:
- **Climate Skepticism**: Arguments disputing the existence or human-caused nature of climate change.
- **Economic Prioritization**: Claims that economic growth and jobs should take precedence over climate action.
- **Downplaying Impacts**: Narratives minimizing the consequences of climate change (e.g., “It’s natural,” “It’s not that bad”).
- **Anti-Regulation**: Opposition to government intervention, often framed as overreach or harmful to personal freedoms.
- **Conspiracy Theories**: Claims that climate change is a hoax or part of a larger political or financial conspiracy.

---

## **4. Integrative**
Climate change is an environmental and social problem rooted in perceptions of human-environment relationships. Addressing it requires cultural and institutional change.

### Sub-Categories:
- **Systems Thinking**: Narratives emphasizing the interconnectedness of human and environmental systems and the need for holistic solutions.
- **Cultural Shifts**: Calls for reframing humanity’s relationship with nature, often incorporating Indigenous knowledge or ecological worldviews.
- **Sustainable Development**: Discussions about balancing economic growth with environmental stewardship and social equity.
- **Interdisciplinary Approaches**: Combining insights from science, humanities, and policy to develop innovative solutions.
- **Behavioral Science**: Focus on psychological and cultural factors that influence climate action and decision-making.

This framework provides a structured approach to classify and analyze climate change discourse, capturing both broad themes and detailed sub-narratives.
