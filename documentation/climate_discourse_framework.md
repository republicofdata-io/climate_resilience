# Climate Discourse Framework: Categories and Sub-Categories

## Introduction
Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges, and how it is discussed—across regions, sectors, and communities—plays a critical role in shaping perceptions, policies, and actions. The **Climate Discourse Framework** provides a structured approach to categorize and analyze these discussions, enabling a deeper understanding of the diverse perspectives and narratives around climate change.

This framework builds on the foundational work of Leichenko & O’Brien, which identifies four primary discourses about climate change: **Biophysical**, **Critical**, **Dismissive**, and **Integrative**. While these high-level categories are useful for organizing broad perspectives, this framework introduces **sub-categories** to capture the nuanced and specific narratives emerging within each discourse.

### Purpose of the Framework
The goal of the Climate Discourse Framework is to:
- Provide a systematic way to analyze climate narratives across time and geography.
- Enable more precise tracking of how narratives form, compete, and evolve.
- Support policymakers, researchers, and communicators in identifying key narratives and designing targeted strategies.

### Why Sub-Categories?
High-level categories are essential for framing broad trends, but climate discourse is highly complex and context-dependent. Sub-categories allow for:
- **Granularity**: Breaking down broader discourses into specific themes for richer analysis.
- **Relevance**: Capturing emerging narratives and evolving public perceptions.
- **Actionability**: Providing actionable insights for communication, policymaking, and advocacy.

The following sections outline the framework’s four main categories and their corresponding sub-categories, each designed to reflect the diversity and complexity of climate change discussions.

## 1. Biophysical
Climate change is seen as an environmental challenge addressable through technological, policy, and individual interventions.

- **Technological Solutions**: Innovations in renewable energy, carbon capture, and other green technologies.
- **Policy Advocacy**: Calls for regulatory measures, carbon pricing, and international agreements.
- **Behavioral Change**: Emphasis on individual actions and lifestyle modifications to reduce emissions.
- **Nature-Based Solutions**: Strategies involving reforestation, ecosystem restoration, and biodiversity conservation.
- **Disaster Preparedness**: Adaptation measures aimed at enhancing resilience against climate impacts.

---

## 2. Critical
Climate change is viewed as a systemic issue rooted in social, economic, and political structures.

- **Climate Justice**: Focus on equity and the disproportionate impact on marginalized communities.
- **Fossil Fuel Opposition**: Critiques of fossil fuel industries and their role in perpetuating emissions.
- **Economic Critique**: Arguments against unsustainable consumption and economic models that drive environmental degradation.
- **Global Inequities**: Discussions on the uneven responsibilities and impacts between the Global North and South.
- **Corporate Accountability**: Demands for holding corporations responsible for environmental harm and greenwashing.

---

## 3. Dismissive
Climate change is considered either a non-issue or not urgent, often prioritizing economic or ideological arguments over environmental concerns.

- **Climate Skepticism**: Disputes regarding the existence or anthropogenic causes of climate change.
- **Economic Prioritization**: Claims that economic growth and job creation should take precedence over climate action.
- **Downplaying Impacts**: Narratives minimizing the severity or consequences of climate change.
- **Anti-Regulation**: Opposition to government interventions and climate-related policies.
- **Conspiracy Theories**: Beliefs that climate change is fabricated or manipulated for ulterior motives.

---

## 4. Integrative
Climate change is understood as a complex, multifaceted issue requiring holistic solutions that bridge environmental and social dimensions.

- **Systems Thinking**: Emphasis on the interconnectedness of human and environmental systems.
- **Cultural Shifts**: Calls for a rethinking of societal values and the incorporation of diverse knowledge systems.
- **Sustainable Development**: Balancing economic growth with environmental stewardship and social equity.
- **Interdisciplinary Approaches**: Combining insights from science, humanities, and policy to craft integrated solutions.
- **Behavioral Science**: Exploring the psychological and cultural dimensions influencing climate action.
- **Emerging Narratives**: Capturing evolving themes such as digital activism, climate anxiety, and other novel discourses.

This framework provides a structured approach to classify and analyze climate change discourse, capturing both broad themes and detailed sub-narratives.
