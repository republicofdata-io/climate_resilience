# Climate Resilience Data Platform

The **Climate Resilience Data Platform** provides structured, AI-driven insights into how climate change is discussed across regions and time. By categorizing public discourse into key narratives, the platform helps researchers, policymakers, and communicators track sentiment shifts and emerging trends with precision.
  
**Key Features**
- **Geotemporal Analysis** – Understand how climate narratives evolve over time and across locations.
- **AI-Powered Classification** – Identify dominant themes (e.g., Biophysical, Critical, Dismissive, Integrative). Learn more about our **[Climate Discourse Framework](link-to-climate-discourse-framework-page)**.
- **Structured Data Outputs** – Actionable datasets for research, policy, and communication.
- **Open-Source & Scalable** – Built with transparency and efficiency in mind.

**Who It’s For**
- **Researchers** – Analyze public sentiment and discourse trends.
- **Policymakers** – Inform climate strategies with real-time narrative insights.
- **Communicators** – Shape messaging based on prevailing public perceptions.
