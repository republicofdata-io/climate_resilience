# climate_narratives

The Climate Resilience Data Platform is a tool I developed to capture and analyze the evolving narratives around climate change. By mining data from media articles and social networks, it offers a way to track how climate discussions shift over time and across different regions.

The platform is built on a layered, modular architecture that emphasizes flexibility and scalability. Dagster is at the core, orchestrating workflows and ensuring that data pipelines run smoothly. Supabase is used for configuration management, while LangChain brings in Generative AI to handle more complex data processing tasks.

One of the key features of the platform is its ability to enrich data with geolocation mapping and narrative labeling. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of where climate stories are gaining traction and how public perception is shaped. The result is a data product that not only collects information but provides deeper insights into the climate discourse.
