# Understanding Public Narratives on Climate Change

The Climate Resilience Data Platform is designed to provide structured, actionable data to better understand the evolving landscape of public climate change discourse. By offering geographically and temporally tagged datasets, the platform supports efforts to analyze and respond to the public’s perception of climate change events with clarity and precision.

## Platform Overview

**Purpose**

To deliver structured data that highlights how climate change events are discussed geographically and temporally, enabling analysis of public sentiment and dominant narratives.

**Open-Source Foundation**

The platform operates transparently, with its methodologies and processes publicly accessible to ensure credibility and reproducibility.

## Core Features

**Geotemporal Analysis**

Tracks public discourse at the intersection of geography and time to reveal regional variations and shifts in sentiment.

**Narrative Classification**

Categorizes conversations into key themes: Biophysical, Critical, Dismissive, and Integrative, offering insights into dominant and emerging climate narratives.

**AI-Driven Processing**

Uses advanced AI agents to enrich and structure data, automating tasks such as discourse classification and narrative association.

**Scalable Architecture**

Built on a modular framework with tools like Dagster (workflow orchestration) and Supabase (configuration management) to efficiently handle large and dynamic datasets.

## Data Outputs

**Categorized Datasets**

Structured data tagged by narrative type, geography, and time, ready for integration into research, policy, or communication workflows.

**Trend Analysis**

Temporal insights into how public sentiment shifts in response to key climate events or policies.

**Geographic Maps**

Visualizations of dominant narratives across regions, providing a clear view of localized sentiment.

## Applications

**Researchers**

Analyze public discourse to identify trends, generate new insights, and support academic studies.

**Policymakers**

Use data to inform region-specific climate strategies or assess the public response to policies.

**Communicators**

Identify prevailing narratives to shape effective messaging and engagement strategies.
